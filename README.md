A fun React learning experience using some assets provided by my Bloc curriculum. This was also my first experience using wireframing and mockups in earnest (which was ultimately very helpful if not a little uncomfortable at first) and I decided to stick with that 80s neon vibe that the logo lead me to, because why not.

This was my first experience using something like React Router and my introduction to what a "slug" is, since they are used to direct to a particular album. This lead me to research the terminology and discover how they don't just help your URL be more descriptive of your content to your users but also have a positive effect on SEO.

There was also a lot of growth for me working with an audio element. Using event listeners for track duration, current time, and volume was a very practical set of lessons. There were also a number of challenges styling some of the elements, specifically the range inputs. There is a lot of WebKit and pseudo-elements behind the scenes of the time bar and there were some odd challenges getting the volume control to position correctly with a vertical orientation. 

Certainly not a masterclass in UX/UI design, but I learned a lot about React, routing, and CSS in this project.
